We have presented algorithms to construct and perform computations in algebraic closures of finite 
fields. Most of our algorithms are quasi-linear in the degree of the extension. Experiments show 
that our algorithms and implementations, which use monomial representation, are superior to 
those based on linear algebra. Future directions of this work would include: (i) Designing more 
efficient algorithms for computing isomorphisms, and (ii) Making the construction of towers 
quasi-linear in all cases.
